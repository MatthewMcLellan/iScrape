# AM_Hirer
- AM_Hirer is our solution to the massive increase in cost of professional services across the board.  If you have an issue with something that needs to be fixed, no more will you have to hire two people to diagnose the problem, hire another to tell you how to fix it, and hire at least one more person to fix it; instead we are skippng that long drawn-out process and just hiring someone who can fix it, spending an amount of of money cheaper than your groceries.
